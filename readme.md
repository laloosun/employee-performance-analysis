- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file).

## Example Output

Here is an example of the output you can expect:

Total Employees: 7 Average ACHT: 6.76 Average CRR: 85.29% Average CSS: 4.54 Highest ACHT: 8.1 Lowest ACHT: 5.6 Highest CRR: 92% Lowest CRR: 78% Highest CSS: 4.9 Lowest CSS: 4.0

### ACHT Distribution:

Excellent (<6): 2 Good (6-7): 3 Average (7-8): 1 Needs Improvement (>=8): 1

This output includes important statistics such as the total number of employees, the average ACHT, CRR, and CSS, as well as the highest and lowest values for each metric. Additionally, it provides a distribution of ACHT into different performance categories to help you quickly assess the overall efficiency of your team.
